This repository will contain two challenges - PyBank and PyPoll

In PyBank, a set of finanacial data composed of two columns - dates and profits will be analyzed and summarized in the following way:
The total number of months included in the data set.
The net total amount of profits and losses over the entire time.
The changes in profits/losses over the entire time.
The average change in profits/losses.
The greatest increase in profits and the corresponding date over the entire time.
THe greatest decrease in profits and the corresponding date over the entire time.

The analysis will print both to the terminal and be exported to a text file.
