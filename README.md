The Python challenge homework consists of two assignments, PyBank and PyPoll.



# PyBank


In the PyBank challenge, a set of finanacial data composed of two columns - dates and profits will be analyzed and summarized, with the following tasks completed: 

  *Calculate the total number of months included in the data set.
  
  *Calculuate net total amount of profits and losses over the entire time.
  
  *Calculate the changes in profits/losses over the entire time.
  
  *Calculate the average change in profits/losses.
  
  *Calculate the greatest increase in profits and the corresponding date over the entire time.
  
  *Calculate the greatest decrease in profits and the corresponding date over the entire time.

A .csv set of data will be imported and used in this program and can be found in the Resources folder.
The analysis will print both to the terminal and be exported to a text file that can be found in the Analysis folder.



# PyPoll

In the PyPoll challenge, a large set of election data from a small town needs to be counted and summarized. The program will perform the following tasks:

 * A count of the total number of votes.

 * A calculuation of the total number of votes that each candidate receives, along with their percentage of total votes.
